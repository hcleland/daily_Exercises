# Write a method called `average` that takes in an array of numbers and returns the average (the sum divided by the total number of numbers). Write it first using a `while` loop, then write it again using an `each` loop. (Hint - if you’re having issues with missing decimals, you may need the .to_f method…)

# p average([2, 1, 7, 5])  #=> 3.75
